    <h1>How to Dress Up Jeans</h1>
    <h3>From: <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Dress-Up-Jeans">Wiki How</a></h3>
    <p>While jeans are traditionally considered casual wear, the right pair can easily be dressed up for your next Casual Friday, romantic date, or night out with friends. As long as you start with the right jeans, you can create a dressy look with the right top, shoes, and accessories.</p>
<ol class="howto">
  <li class="active"><h2>Step 1: Make sure your jeans fit properly.  </h2>
      <img src="https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/40/Dress-Up-Jeans-Step-1-Version-3.jpg/aid1311210-v4-728px-Dress-Up-Jeans-Step-1-Version-3.jpg" alt="">
      <p>Choose a pair of jeans that flatters your figure and fits your body. Avoid jeans that are too snug in the hips and thighs. For a dressy look, you should also avoid jeans that are loose and baggy. </p>
  </li>
  <li><h2>Step 2: Choose jeans which fit well in the waist. </h2>

      <p>Make sure your jeans rise high enough in the waist to provide coverage when you sit down. Low-rise jeans usually look more youthful and casual than other styles, so opt for a medium or high rise for a dressier appearance.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h2>Step 3: Avoid jeans with holes or stains. </h2>
      <img src="https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/bf/Dress-Up-Jeans-Step-3-Version-3.jpg/aid1311210-v4-728px-Dress-Up-Jeans-Step-3-Version-3.jpg" alt="">
      <p>Distressed jeans are popular, but they give off an extremely casual vibe. If you're trying to dress up, make sure your jeans don't have holes and are free from stains. </p>
  </li>
  <li><h2>Step 4: Choose dark jeans over lighter colors if you have them.  </h2>
      <img src="https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/e0/Dress-Up-Jeans-Step-4-Version-3.jpg/aid1311210-v4-728px-Dress-Up-Jeans-Step-4-Version-3.jpg" alt="">
      <p>You can still dress up light to medium wash jeans, but darker shades of denim look nicer and more formal than lighter shades. Dark wash jeans are also the most appropriate for casual business occasions.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h2>Step 5: Go with a classic cut, such as boot-cut or straight, for versatility. </h2>
      <img src="https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/1b/Dress-Up-Jeans-Step-5-Version-3.jpg/aid1311210-v4-728px-Dress-Up-Jeans-Step-5-Version-3.jpg" alt="">
      <p>A skinny jean may work under some circumstances, but they can look more rock-star than dressy. Boot-cut or straight-leg jeans more closely resemble trousers, and they will work for nearly anything from a fun night out with friends to a casual meeting with a new client. </p>
  </li>
  <li><h2>Step 6: Wear a colored jean for a bold, stylish look. </h2>
      <img src="https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/e4/Dress-Up-Jeans-Step-6-Version-3.jpg/aid1311210-v4-728px-Dress-Up-Jeans-Step-6-Version-3.jpg" alt="">
      <p>Black or white denim can be dressed up with relative ease. You might also be able to create a dressy look by pairing a brightly-colored denim with a blouse in a coordinating color or pattern. </p>
